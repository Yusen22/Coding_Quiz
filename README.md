# Web Development Code Quiz 


## Description

This project provides a quiz application that asks the user to answer questions on the subject on web development. Each user is given 60 seconds to complete the quiz, subject to a 10 second time penalty if an incorrect answer is provided. When the time expires, the user will be given the option to submit their initials and final score, and view the ten highest stored high scores. The quiz can then be restarted, or the stored high scores can be cleared from storage.

## Usage

Initially, click the 'Start Quiz' button to generate the first quiz question. The user will then be provided with four answers related to the displayed question, one of which is correct. Upon selecting an answer, the application will inform if the answer is correct or incorrect, and generate a new question.

Open Chrome DevTools on the page using shortcut 'Shift + CTRL + J' and navigating to 'Console' to see the current round and current score printed for each round. 

The time remaining to complete the quiz is displayed in the top-right hand corner. When the timer expires, and reaches 0, the application will move to the result screen, showing the user score. Enter initials into the provided submit box and click 'Submit' to save the score to the stored high scores. The stored high scores will then be displayed in order of score. Click 'Back' to return to the home screen, or 'Clear Highscores' to reset the high score list. The application will then confirm that this action wants to be taken, which can be confirmed or denied. 

The high scores can be viewed at any time during the quiz by clicking the 'View Highscores' link in the top-left corner of the application.
